- construct expression tree from postfix expression (with stack)
- postfix expression from in-order traversal of expression tree
- simplify expression tree
- mapping variables in expression tree
- (a-b) -> +,a,*,-1,b
- associtativity and commutativity
- level indicates operator precedence (operations at lower levels are evaluated later)
